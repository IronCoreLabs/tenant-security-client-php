# Tenant Security Client PHP Library

A PHP client for implementing CMK within a vendor's infrastructure. Makes requests through an
IronCore Tenant Security Proxy to tenants' KMS/logging infrastructures.

This project is still in very early stages, but will eventually implement everything that is in our [Java](https://github.com/ironcorelabs/tenant-security-client-java) and [Node](https://github.com/IronCoreLabs/tenant-security-client-nodejs/) sdks.

A good place to start is the TenantSecurityClient class, which is what the consumer should always interact with. Examples are coming soon! The usage is very similar
to that shown in our [Java Examples](https://github.com/IronCoreLabs/tenant-security-client-java/tree/main/examples).
