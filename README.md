# Tenant Security Client PHP Library

A PHP client for implementing CMK within a vendor's infrastructure. Makes requests through an
IronCore Tenant Security Proxy to tenants' KMS/logging infrastructures.

This project is still in very early stages, but will eventually implement everything that is in our [Java](https://github.com/ironcorelabs/tenant-security-client-java) and [Node](https://github.com/IronCoreLabs/tenant-security-client-nodejs/) sdks.

A good place to start is the [TenantSecurityClient](https://ironcorelabs.github.io/tenant-security-client-php/classes/IronCore-TenantSecurityClient.html) class, which is what the consumer should always interact with. You can also go check out the [examples](https://github.com/IronCoreLabs/tenant-security-client-php/tree/main/Examples).

If you're looking for more examples the usage is very similar to that shown in our [Java Examples](https://github.com/IronCoreLabs/tenant-security-client-java/tree/main/examples).
